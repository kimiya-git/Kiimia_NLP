Collective action at the local, national, and global levels is necessary to mitigate the impacts of climate change and build a more sustainable future for generations to come. 
Climate change refers to long-term shifts and alterations in temperature and weather patterns, primarily due to human activities such as burning fossil fuels. The primary driver of recent climate change is the increase in greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, particularly carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O). This includes building resilient infrastructure, implementing early warning systems for extreme weather events, and developing strategies to protect vulnerable communities and ecosystems. Ecosystems and biodiversity are also under threat due to climate change.
